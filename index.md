# What is Kolic?

Kolic is a fictional language spoken by a handful of island communities living 
around the southern polar circle of a fictional world. The technological level 
of these societies roughly corresponds to medieval northern Europe, and the vibe 
is very much inspired by the franchise How To Train Your Dragon.

The language itself takes a lot of inspiration from Icelandic, which is obvious 
from its phonetic inventory, phonotactics, some grammar and morphology, 
orthography and romanisation, but there's also influence from Finnish, Swedish, 
Scottish Gaelic, Czech, and some others. The more I develop the language, the 
further I try to get from Icelandic - it was a nice base to base the vibes off 
of at the beginning, but Kolic deserves its own identity.

Even though one of Kolic’s goals is naturalism, my main goal is the vibes. I 
just want Kolic to be a language I like the vibes of. Naturalism is a big 
contributor to that, but there may be instances where I sacrifice a bit of it to 
get a language I find prettier.

You can also visit my [Tumblr blog](https://www.tumblr.com/kolic) where I try to
document my development of the language in a more chronological manner.

# Phonology
_Main site: [Phonology](phonology.md)_

The phonology of Kolic, just like its many other aspects, is primarily inspired 
by Icelandic. Its signature features include voiceless sonorants, dental 
fricatives, and a moderately large vowel inventory. 

Kolic has undergone several umlauts, including an i-triggered retrograde umlaut 
earlier in its history, and another currently ongoing prograde umlaut, triggered 
by all front vowels, and only applied to some grammatical affixes.
