# Nouns {#nouns}

Kolic nouns decline for case and number. They are categorised into four noun classes, or grammatical genders.

If a noun ends in a vowel, that vowel is considered part of the [lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(morphology)), but not the [stem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem), instead being considered a [suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix#Inflectional_suffixes). This suffix is replaced when the noun is declined into other forms. Moreover, if the resulting suffix is 〈i〉, the stem takes the form without the [i-umlaut](phonology.md#i-umlaut) applied, as seen in the example word örði.

This table details how the lemma forms are analysed:

| **Lemma**  | teiga | kvils | kír   | örði  | hríð  | 
| ---------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Stem**   | teig  | kvils | kír   | orð   | hríð  |
| **Suffix** | -a    | -Ø    | -Ø    | -i    | -Ø    |

_* -Ø denotes a null suffix._

## Grammatical gender {#gender}

There are four grammatical genders in Kolic --- the feminine, neuter, masculine, and diminutive. There is no animacy distinction and all four genders can refer to referents thought of as animate, as the classes correspond to the Kolic social three gender system, which actually developed into its current form thanks to the grammatical gender system, among other factors.

Feminine words tend to end with the vowel /a/ in the nominative singular, or less commonly with a consonant (see words like kvils, kól). The lemma form can end in a vowel different than /a/ only in loanwords (e.g. Rósi - the feminine name Rosie. Note that this loanword, just like other loanwords from real-world languages, is not cannonical, but can be used by real life speakers to express things that don't exist in-universe, such as their names).

Masculine words tend to end with the vowel /i/ or with a consonant, and very rarely with a different vowel (the same loanword exception applies).

Neuter words almost always end with a consonant (the same loanword exception applies). Words that have multiple gendered forms (like terms that describe people) take the neuter as their default and epicene form.

Note that loanwords that refer to subjects with a social gender, such as given names, _can_ end with endings otherwise atypical for that gender, and still retain the grammatical gender that corresponds to the social gender. The word is then declined the same way as any other word of that grammatical gender would be, according to whether it ends with a vowel or a consonant.

The diminutive gender is quite unlike the others, as its members are virtually always derived from roots of other genders using the suffix `-jun`. However, they do have their own set of declensions, and adjectives and vebs display agreement with the diminutive gender, so it is considered a separate gender. The diminutive gender is used for usual diminutives, for names of objects derived from other names by diminution (e.g. týðrujun --- writing tablet, from týðri --- plank), to refer to children, which are almost never refered to by the three other genders, and for forming pet names for partners and close friends.

A root can be made into a diminutive by <!--either suffixing `-jun` onto the root if the [phonotactics](phonology.md#phonotactics) allow it (e.g Hildjun - pet name or child name for Hilda), or by suffixing `-ujun` if suffixing `-jun` would result in a cluster that's disallowed by Kolic phonology (e.g. týðrjun would either produce two consecutive sonorants /rj/ within the onset of a syllable, or a sonorant after a fricative in the coda of a syllable, depending on analysis, both of which are disallowed by the phonotactics, so týðrujun is used instead).--> suffixing `-jun` onto the root (e.g. Hildjun - a pet name or child name for Hilda, or týðrjun - a writing tablet, from týðri - a plank)

## Number {#number}

Kolic has two grammatical numbers --- singular and plural.

The plural number is indicated by a suffix ending in -i, however, the suffixes vary between genders and get surrounded by and blended with other suffixes in other cases.

## Case {#case}

🚧 This section is a Work In Progress 🚧

Kolic has an extensive case system, with up to 59 cases in total, however most of them can be analysed as combinations of suffixes. These cases are usually separated into two categories - 8 basic cases, and 51 locatives. As previously mentioned, the locatives can be thought of as combining two types of suffixes - one specifying position relative to the referent (12 locative positions), and one specifying a direction in relation to that location (4 locative directions). In some cases, these affixes blend together instead of simply existing next to one another. 

Kolic has a nominative-accusative alignment. It lacks a dative case, with nominals in the dative function being marked with the [lative case](#lative-description). The [genitive](#genitive-description) is often used as a partitive or second accusative. More info in the individual case descriptions.

You can read a description of each case's function in the [Case Descriptions](case_descriptions.md) page.

### Declensions - Basic Cases {#noun-basic-declensions}

The declension tables are split by grammatical number. Columns are split by gender and by whether they end in a vowel or a consonant. Note the application of the [i-umlaut](phonology.md#i-umlaut) in all declensions ending with the letter 〈i〉, **including the masculine nominative forms ending with the vowel 〈i〉.** In this case, the other declensions (not ending with 〈i〉) display a reverse-umlaut, where these forms retain their original unumlauted spelling and pronunciation.

Also note that when a declension is marked with "---", the [lemma form](#nouns) is used, but if a suffix is provided, it is suffixed only to the [stem](#nouns) and the original suffix is replaced.

_* C means geminating the last consonant. If the consonant is already geminated in the singular nominative, this step is skipped (e.g. þreitt becomes þreitti in the plural nominative)._

_* If a suffix's first vowel glyph is \<i\> or \<í\>, it triggers the [i-umlaut](phonology.md#i-umlaut) in the root._

_* The vowel /ɑ/ (represented by \<a\>), if found as the first vowel in a grammatical suffix, shifts to /a/ (represented by \<ä\>) if the preceding vowel is a front one (/a, ɛ, ɪ, i, œ, ʏ/, represented by \<ä, e, ë, i, y, í, ý, ö, ú\>). Note that this shift **only** happens in grammatical suffixes, and does not affect roots._

## Participles {#participles}

### The Past Participle {#past-participle}

The past participle is formed by suffixing "-g" to the infinitive minus the "r" ending, and an agreement suffix depending on gender, case, and number agreement, exactly like a typical adjective (section under construction).

_Líttar (throw) → líttaga, líttag, líttägi (thrown)_
_Súgðar (weigh down) → súgðaga, súgðag, súgðägi (weighed down)_
_Túfnir (fall) → túfniga, túfnig, túfnigi (fallen)_

The past participle is used when an adjective describes the result of an action.

## Ýþ {#conjunctions-ýþ}

Ýþ is a [Complementiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementizer), introducing a clause that functions as an argument of a verb. It shares its form with the demonstrative "ýþ" meaning "this," but can be reduced based on phonological context. If the following word starts with a liquid (a vowel or a liquid consonant), ýþ gets reduced to a "þ-" prefix.

_Jaeða gär ýþ þúva ár rikðir - I know she can hunt_

_Jaeða gär þaera ár þúnda - I know she's pretty_

## Äëþ ... äëþ {#conjunctions-äëþ-äëþ}

Äëþ ... äëþ is a phrasal conjunction that expresses that a degree of an adjective is so large, that the clause after the conjunction holds. It can be translated as the English "so ... that"

_Aeru gär **äëþ** súgðag **äëþ** järiftu gär rälpa - I am **so** stressed **that** I feel sick_
