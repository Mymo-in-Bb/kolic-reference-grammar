# Nouns {#nouns}

Kolic nouns decline for case and number. They are categorised into four noun classes, or grammatical genders.

If a noun ends in a vowel, that vowel is considered part of the [lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(morphology)), but not the [stem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem), instead being considered a [suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix#Inflectional_suffixes). This suffix is replaced when the noun is declined into other forms. Moreover, if the resulting suffix is 〈i〉, the stem takes the form without the [i-umlaut](phonology.md#i-umlaut) applied, as seen in the example word örði.

This table details how the lemma forms are analysed:

| **Lemma**  | teiga | kvils | kír   | örði  | hríð  | 
| ---------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Stem**   | teig  | kvils | kír   | orð   | hríð  |
| **Suffix** | -a    | -Ø    | -Ø    | -i    | -Ø    |

_* -Ø denotes a null suffix._

## Grammatical gender {#gender}

There are four grammatical genders in Kolic --- the feminine, neuter, masculine, and diminutive. There is no animacy distinction and all four genders can refer to referents thought of as animate, as the classes correspond to the Kolic social three gender system, which actually developed into its current form thanks to the grammatical gender system, among other factors.

Feminine words tend to end with the vowel /a/ in the nominative singular, or less commonly with a consonant (see words like kvils, kól). The lemma form can end in a vowel different than /a/ only in loanwords (e.g. Rósi - the feminine name Rosie. Note that this loanword, just like other loanwords from real-world languages, is not cannonical, but can be used by real life speakers to express things that don't exist in-universe, such as their names).

Masculine words tend to end with the vowel /i/ or with a consonant, and very rarely with a different vowel (the same loanword exception applies).

Neuter words almost always end with a consonant (the same loanword exception applies). Words that have multiple gendered forms (like terms that describe people) take the neuter as their default and epicene form.

Note that loanwords that refer to subjects with a social gender, such as given names, _can_ end with endings otherwise atypical for that gender, and still retain the grammatical gender that corresponds to the social gender. The word is then declined the same way as any other word of that grammatical gender would be, according to whether it ends with a vowel or a consonant.

The diminutive gender is quite unlike the others, as its members are virtually always derived from roots of other genders using the suffix `-jun`. However, they do have their own set of declensions, and adjectives and vebs display agreement with the diminutive gender, so it is considered a separate gender. The diminutive gender is used for usual diminutives, for names of objects derived from other names by diminution (e.g. týðrujun --- writing tablet, from týðri --- plank), to refer to children, which are almost never refered to by the three other genders, and for forming pet names for partners and close friends.

A root can be made into a diminutive by <!--either suffixing `-jun` onto the root if the [phonotactics](phonology.md#phonotactics) allow it (e.g Hildjun - pet name or child name for Hilda), or by suffixing `-ujun` if suffixing `-jun` would result in a cluster that's disallowed by Kolic phonology (e.g. týðrjun would either produce two consecutive sonorants /rj/ within the onset of a syllable, or a sonorant after a fricative in the coda of a syllable, depending on analysis, both of which are disallowed by the phonotactics, so týðrujun is used instead).--> suffixing `-jun` onto the root (e.g. Hildjun - a pet name or child name for Hilda, or týðrjun - a writing tablet, from týðri - a plank)

## Number {#number}

Kolic has two grammatical numbers --- singular and plural.

## Case {#case}

🚧 This section is a Work In Progress 🚧

Kolic has an extensive case system, with up to 59 cases in total, however most of them can be analysed as combinations of suffixes. These cases are usually separated into two categories - 8 basic cases, and 51 locatives. As previously mentioned, the locatives can be thought of as combining two types of suffixes - one specifying position relative to the referent (12 locative positions), and one specifying a direction in relation to that location (4 locative directions). In some cases, these affixes blend together instead of simply existing next to one another. 

Kolic has a nominative-accusative alignment. It lacks a dative case, with nominals in the dative function being marked with the [lative case](). The [genitive](#genitive-description) is often used as a partitive or second accusative. More info in the individual case descriptions.

### Descriptions of basic cases {#basic-case-descriptions}

#### Nominative {#nominative-description}

The nominative case is used for the subject of sentences.

Kolic is a nominative-accusative language, which means that the subject of an intransitive sentence is marked the same way as the object of the transitive sentence. The object of a transitive sentence is marked separately (see the [accusative](#accusative-desciption) case).

#### Accusative {#accusative-description}

The accusative case marks the direct object of transitive sentences. 

Note that if the direct object is a pronoun, it is usually infixed into the verb.

> TODO: Add link after the section is done

#### Dative {#dative-description}

The dative case is usually not analysed as its own case in Kolic. It is instead analysed as a different (but related) use of the [static locative directional case](static-desciption) without any positional case.

#### Genitive {#genitive-description}

The genitive case (sometimes called the gentive-partitive in Kolic) marks a noun as modifying another noun, making it an attribute of the noun. It can be used for possessives, but note that Kolic has a separate way of deriving possessive adjectives from nouns, that is used more often.

Aside from the genitive function, the Kolic genitive also functions as a partitive - denoting partialness, or a (non-complete) quantity.

English Examples:

*“They built a <ins>dog</ins> house.”* - Although this is an example of a noun in a genitive function, this construction would usually be translated to Kolic using a compound noun, i.e. *a doghouse*. Note that the construction of compound nouns in Kolic puts the modifying noun (prefixed to the main noun) in a special form sometimes called the “compound form,” suffixing it with “u,” instead of using the genitive case. (Example: kyfð örðin = a house of a dog → örðukyfð = a doghouse)

*“This is the boat <ins>of Gael</ins>.”* - A semantically possessive function of a genitive. This sentence would more likely be expressed using the possessive form, which could be translated to English as *“This is Gael’s boat.”*

*“She took a sip <ins>of water</ins>.”* - This is an example of the gentive performing the partitive function.

#### Vocative {#vocative-description}

The vocative case is used for addressing or calling to another person, animal or object.

English Examples:

*“How are you, <ins>Hilda</ins>?”*

*“<ins>Spot</ins>, come here!”*

> TODO: Add example of a vocation to an inanimate object. Probably from some poem

#### Comitative {#comitative-description}

The comitative case marks accompaniment. As opposed to the instrumental case, it can be translated as the English “with,” but **only when if it’s used to mark accompaniment,** not if it’s used to mark a tool. The English preposition "with" meaning "using" can be translated through the [instrumental](instrumental-description) case (see below).

English examples:

*“I’m going <ins>with Hilda</ins>.”*

*“I’d like to wipe the floor <ins>with you</ins>.”* - as in “I’d like us to wipe the floor together”

> WARNING
> ❌ *“I’m writing with a pencil”* - not the comitative case.

#### Instrumental {#instrumental-description}

A noun marked with the instrumental case is used as a tool with which an action is performed. It can be translated as the English preposition “using” or “with,” but **only if it’s used to mark a tool with which an action is performed**. The English preposition “with” meaning “accompanying,” can be translated through the [comitative](comitative-description) case (see above).

English examples:

*“I’m writing <ins>with a pencil</ins>.”*

*“I’d like to wipe the floor <ins>with you</ins>.”* - as in “I’d like to use you as the mop,” or more likely as a metaphor for beating someone up.

> WARNING
> ❌ *“I’m going <ins>with Hilda</ins>”* - not the instrumental case.


#### Abessive {#abessive-description}

The abessive case is in a sense the opposite of the comitative - it is the equivalent of the english preposition “without.” 

Note that it can even be used as the opposite of the instrumental case, despite it being separate from the comitative.

English examples:

*“<ins>Without meat</ins>, please.”*

*“If she doesn’t want to go, we’ll go <ins>without her</ins>.”*

*“I wrote the essay <ins>without a pencil<ins>.”*

#### Benefactive {benefactive-description}

The benefactive case is the equivalent of the English “for.” It can also mark the intended result of an action, or the cause of an action.

English examples:

*“Gael baked a cake <ins>for her</ins>.”*

*“We’ll be late <ins>because of</ins> his <ins>delay</ins>”*

*“I’m walking slowly, <ins>so that</ins> I <ins>don’t spill it</ins>.”*

### Descriptions of locatives (directions) {#locative-direction-descriptions}

#### Static {#static-description}

The static direction is used whenever the subject is _in_ the position described by the case marker, relative to the referent. For example, if used with the postessive on the noun "wall", it means the subject is behind a wall. See the other directions for contrast.

#### Lative {#lative-description}

The lative direction is used whenever the subject is transitioning into the position described by the case marker, relative to the referent. For example, if used with the postessive on the noun "wall," it means the subject is going behind a wall.

The lative direction is also used as a dative case.

The dative function of the lative case marks the indirect object of sentences. It *usually* relates to giving.

English examples:

*“I gave <ins>Hilda</ins> a pencil.”*

*“She’s singing a lullaby <ins>to the baby</ins>.”*

> NOTE
> 💡The dative case is also used when comparing. For example, “She’s older than him” and “They have the same amount as him” is said “She’s older to him” and “They have the same amount to him” respectively.

#### Ablative {#ablative-description}

The ablative direction is used whenever the subject is transitioning from the position described by the case marker, relative to the referent. For example, if used with the postessive on the noun "wall," it means the subject is going from behind a wall.

#### Perlative {#perlative-description}

The ablative direction is used whenever the subject is moving through the position described by the case marker, relative to the referent. For example, if used with the postessive on the noun "wall," it means the subject is going through the space behind a wall.

### Descriptions of locatives (positions) {#locative-position-descriptions}

#### Inessive {#inessive-description}

The inessive case marks a position inside of the marked object (or a motion to the inside, from the inside, or through the inside, depending on the direction. This is true for all the locatives and will be assumed implicitly in the rest of the case descriptions. They will, however, all have at least one English example given, in the order Static - Lative - Ablative - Perlative)

English Examples:

*“I’m <ins>at school</ins> right now.”* - Static = inside

*“I’m going into the house!”* - Lative = to the inside

*“It hatches from an egg.”* - Ablative = from the inside

*“The path goes through a tunnel.”* - Perlative = through the inside

#### Adessive {#adessive-description}

#### Apudessive {#apudessive-desciption}

#### Postessive {#postessive-desciption}

#### Antessive {#antessive-description}

#### Superessive {#superessive-desciption}

#### Subessive {#subessive-desciption}

#### Elevative {#elevative-description}

#### Pergressive {#Pergressive-description}

#### Intrative {#intrative-description}

#### Transessive {#transessive-description}

> [!WARNING]
> This term was made up by me, because I couldn't find any existing terminology. Please let me know if you know of some, or if you think I could name this better.

This case roughly corresponds to the English "against" or "across." Precisely, it expresses a location _accross_ some space or object from the referred object.

Transessive can also be used in an orientative function.

Examples:

> TODO: Add the Kolic translations and glost

My house is across [the street] from yours.

We went against them (to meet them)

She stood across from them (before them).

They stood across from each other.

#### Essive {#essive-desciption}

### Declensions {#noun-declensions}

The declension tables are split by grammatical number. Columns are split by gender and by whether they end in a vowel or a consonant. Note the application of the [i-umlaut](phonology.md#i-umlaut) in all declensions ending with the letter 〈i〉, **including the masculine nominative forms ending with the vowel 〈i〉.** In this case, the other declensions (not ending with 〈i〉) display a reverse-umlaut, where these forms retain their original unumlauted spelling and pronunciation.

Also note that when a declension is marked with "---", the [lemma form](#nouns) is used, but if a suffix is provided, it is suffixed only to the [stem](#nouns) and the original suffix is replaced.
